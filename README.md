# Medical Database History SQL Analysis

## Project Overview
- **Project Title**: Medical Database History SQL Analysis
- **Database**: `project_medical_data_history`

This project was assigned by Rubixe - AI Solutions Company in my internship to help strengthen my SQL skills.The main objective was to analyze a medical database by solving 34 structured SQL tasks. The queries focus on patient demographics, admissions, diagnoses, and doctor information.

The database consisted of four tables:
- **patients** - patient demographics and health details (5,000+ records)
- **admissions** - hospital admissions and diagnoses (4,500+ records)
- **doctors** - doctor information and specialties (25+ records)
- **province_names** - province ID to name mapping (few records)

**Note**: The dataset is proprietary and provided by Rubixe - AI Solutions, so it is not included in this repository. Only SQL solutions and analysis are shared.

## Skills Used
- SQL Querying (SELECT, WHERE, LIKE, BETWEEN)
- Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- String and Date functions (CONCAT, YEAR, LENGTH, DAY)
- Joins (INNER JOIN, UNION)
- Conditional Logic (CASE statements)
- Problem-Solving through query writing

## Repository Structure

The repository includes:
1. **EDA & Schema Overview** - row counts and column structures for each table.
2. **34 SQL Queries** - each assigned task solved with its respective query.
3. **Key Insights** - my personal observations and analysis from the queries.


## 3. Key Insights
 After solving the assigned tasks, I also analyzed the dataset further to extract my own insights.
 (I will add these insights here after analysis)



## Acknowledgment
This project was completed as part of my internship at Rubixe - AI Solutions Company. The dataset and tasks were provided by the company for learning and analysis purposes.
